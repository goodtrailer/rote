## Client
### High Priority
* /flashcardsets/:id (stars, delete)
* /flashcardsets/new
* /users/:id
* /login
* wrapper (logout, profile)
### Low Priority
* flashcardsets/:id (editing)
* could reuse page arrows for flashcard slide, though IMO it looks bad so maybe not

## Server
### High Priority
* POST users/:id/stars
* DELETE users/:id/stars/:setId
### Low Priority
* PUT flashcardsets/:id

## Misc
* host somewhere (probably another oracle cloud server)
* either setup guide or docker
