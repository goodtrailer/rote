# TODO

## Client
### High Priority
* /flashcardsets/:id (stars)
* storing user in localStorage (much faster)
### Low Priority
* flashcardsets/:id (editing)
* could reuse page arrows for flashcard slide, though IMO it looks bad so maybe not

## Server
### High Priority
* POST users/:id/stars
* DELETE users/:id/stars/:setId
### Low Priority
* PUT flashcardsets/:id
