# TODO

## Client
### High Priority
* flashcardsets
* flashcardsets/:id (stars)
* users/:id
* signup
* login
* logout
### Low Priority
* flashcardsets/:id (editing)
* could reuse page arrows for flashcard slide, though IMO it looks bad so maybe not

## Server
### High Priority
* POST users/:id/stars
* DELETE users/:id/stars/:setId
* actual CORS support
### Low Priority
* PUT flashcardsets/:id

## Misc
* host somewhere (probably another oracle cloud server)
* either setup guide or docker
